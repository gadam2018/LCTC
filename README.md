Light Color Temperature Control System.
This repository presents mainly the code listings of a platform prototype based on the low-cost and low-power Arduino UNO R4 WiFi BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) board, which enables experiments with LED color temperature control approaches. 
The developed architectural platform utilizes a mobile (wearable) spectrophotometer unit, as an embedded sensing device, positioned approximately near at personâ€™s eye level, and used to sense and retrieve the light parameters used to estimate the optimum color temperature levels. The master control module communicates wirelessly over 2.4GHz BLE with a slave module, which receives the color temperature and dimming control values and drives accordingly a cool and warm white LED, whenever a change in light color temperature is needed (in the rest of the time remains idle, conserving energy).
